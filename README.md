OpenBVE
=======
This is a fork of OpenBVE 1.4.2 and 1.4.3.

New features
------------
* SDL2 & OpenTK as replacement for deprecated Tao

TODOs
-----
Here are some of the goals of this repository (they're not ordered):

* Improve documentation level 
* [Roadmap](https://sites.google.com/site/openbvesim/Roadmap) goals
* Change internal representation of route to allow multi-track levels
* Implement BVE 5 compatibility (if possible, with multi-track)
* Implement multiplayer (after multi-track)
* Implement OpenGL menu *(cross-platformness)*
* Implement gamepad support
* Bring managed content back to life

And maybe in distant future:

* Mobile version (primarily for Android, maybe iOS, if some Mac guy helps me)

Abandoning this project
-----------------------
I'm not planning to leave this project at any time but because I'm a student, I might not have enough free time to actively maintain this project, so please be patient if I don't respond.
