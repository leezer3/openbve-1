OpenBVE
=======
This is forked version of OpenBVE, created by 3-way diff from OpenBVE 1.4.2 and OpenBVE 1.4.3 (addons preserved)

Goals & notes
-------------
Here are some goals of this repository (they're not ordered):
* Move from Tao and SDL to OpenTK
* Centralized development
* Code review
* Good documentation 
* Roadmap goals
* Implement BVE 5 compatibility (if possible)
* Implement OpenGL menu *(I hate WinForms on Linux)*
