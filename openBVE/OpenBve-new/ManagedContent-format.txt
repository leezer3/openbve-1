This is rough description of OpenBVE's add-on list format.
Note: little-endian byte order is used.
Contents:
    A. External envelope format
    B. Internal data format

### A. External envelope format ###
This format consists of these:
    1. File header, must be "TSF_LIST"
    2. 32bit signed integer indicating the version, must be 2
    3. 16 byte MD5 hash of gzip archive
    4. 32bit signed integer indicating the length of gzip archive
    5. Gzip archive itself
    6. File footer, must be "_END"

### B. Internal data format ###
This is a list of packages and their metadata. It contains roughly this:
    1. File header, must be "strt"
    2. 32bit signed integer indicating the package count
    3. Package list
    4. File footer, must be "_end"

Single package entry consists of these:
    1. Package name string*
    2. 32bit signed integer indicating the number of versions
    4. List of versions
        I. Version number string*
        II. 32bit signed integer indicating the source count
        III. List of sources
            1. 32bit signed integer indicating the size of source's data
            2. 16 byte MD5 hash of source's data
            3. URL address of the source*
        IV. 32bit signed integer indicating the dependencies count
        V. List of dependencies
            1. Dependency package name string*
            2. Dependency package version string*
        VI. 32bit signed integer indicating the suggestions count
        VII. List of suggestions
            1. Suggestions package name string*
            2. Suggestions package version string*
        VIII. 32bit signed integer indicating the metadata key-value pair count
        IX. List of metadata key-value pairs
            1. Key string*
                Note: Language-specific values are specified by appending [language_code] to the key.
            2. Value string*



Notes: *for details about writing strings and their lengths, look at documentation for BianryReader.ReadString. There's simplified version:
    1. 7bit unsigned integer indicating the string length
    2. String itself encoded as UTF-8
